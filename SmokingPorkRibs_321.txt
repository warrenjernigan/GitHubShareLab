1. Smoke ribs for 3 hours
Start with exposing the seasoned ribs to 3 hours of heavy smoke
over low heat. I prefer fruit woods (apple or cherry) when smoking
chicken, but other hardwoods (hickory and alder) also work really well 
with ribs.

2. Wrap for 2 hours
After the initial 3-hour smoke, foil the ribs with a liquid of your
choosing (I used apple cider, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, and 
2-3 Tablespoons of butter) and cook at 225-250 degrees for 2 more 
hours. After the braising period I look for great retraction of the 
meat from the bones. I want the bones to be exposed on the end at 
least 1/4 to 1/2 an inch.

3. Sauce and smoke for 1 hour
Lastly, baste the ribs basted in your favorite BBQ sauce and return
them to the grill for a final hour to hour and a half to finish the 
ribs and set the sauce
